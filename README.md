# Welcome to Cyber WVU Labs on Rails

This application is designed for leaders in Cyber WVU to create deliverables for members to complete 
at each meeting.  A Cyber WVU official can view each member's answers they submit and give medals based
on performance. 

### TODO:

1. Answers MVC
  - Associated with lab_templates model
  - Needs page for members to submit answers and for officials to review
  - Also needs database model
  
2. Different Question Types
  - As of 11/17/14 officials can only create free form Q/A
  - We would like T/F, multiple choice, etc.

3. Medal Creation
  - Already implemented in [cyberwvu-badges](https://github.com/CyberWVU/cyber-badges-app)
  - Officials can give medals to members
  - Leaderboard page will show members with most medals
